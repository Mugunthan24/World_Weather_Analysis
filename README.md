# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
Using OpenWeather and Google Places API, customers can filter (temperature) for their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. Additionally, matplotlib was used to create a series of scatterplots to show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world. Statistical calculations were performed using linear regression on the weather parameters on the northern and southern hemispheres. This data will help predict the best time of the year for customers to plan their vacations based on certain weather criteria. The results were then mapped using gmaps and the Google Places API.
